# Spring-Based Actuator Simulation for Cycle Time Reduction

This repository contains a simulation model of a spring-based actuator created using **Ansys Workbench**. The primary objective of the simulation is to evaluate the impact of the actuator on reducing cycle time by introducing energy into the system. The model specifically focuses on the behavior of a translational joint subjected to force from the actuator, with outputs including deformations and force distribution over time.

## Project Overview

In this project, a spring-based actuator was integrated into a mechanical system to demonstrate its potential in reducing cycle time by contributing energy. The simulation captures key parameters such as:
- **Total Deformations**: To observe the physical deformation of the system under the applied forces.
- **Force in X Direction**: To quantify the actuator's contribution to the system's motion, particularly at the translational joint.
- **Animation**: A visual representation of the system's behavior over time, showcasing the dynamic effects of the actuator.

## Key Features

- **Simulation Model**: Created in **Ansys Workbench**, focusing on a spring-based actuator interacting with a translational joint.
- **Deformation Analysis**: Plots showing total deformations in the system.
- **Force Distribution**: Graph illustrating the force applied to the translational joint in the X direction, highlighting the energy input from the actuator.
- **GIF Animation**: A dynamic animation to visually represent the model's behavior over time.
